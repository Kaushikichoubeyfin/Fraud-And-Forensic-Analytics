# Fraud-And-Forensic-Analytics
Benford’s law states that the leading digits of many data sets are not uniformly distributed from one through nine, but rather exhibit a profound bias. Its evident in electricity bills and addresses to stock prices and the lengths of rivers. The law successfully used to expose fraud in elections, medical tests, tax filings and financial reports. 
Hence, Benford's law of anomalous numbers states that generally, in naturally 
occurring collections of numbers, 
the leading digit is likely to be small

>This means that the numeral 1 will be the leading digit in a genuine dataset 
30.1 percent of the time; the numeral 2 will be the leading digit 17.6 percent 
of the time; and each subsequent numeral, 3 through 9, will be the leading 
digit with decreasing frequency

>The resulting downward-sloping curve can be used as a baseline for 
determining whether a dataset is genuine or fabricated
